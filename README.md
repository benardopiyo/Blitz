# Blitz

Blitz is a high-performance file indexing system written in Go. It parses text files into fixed-size chunks, generates SimHash fingerprints for similarity matching, and builds an in-memory index for fast retrieval.

## Features

- **Efficient Chunking**: Split large text files into configurable size chunks
- **SimHash Fingerprinting**: Generate fingerprints that allow similar text to have similar hashes
- **Fast Lookups**: Find text quickly using the pre-built index
- **Parallel Processing**: Utilizes all available CPU cores for faster processing
- **Fuzzy Search**: Supports approximate matching through SimHash similarity

## Requirements

- Go 1.18 or higher

## Building the Application

To build the Blitz CLI tool:

```bash
make run or go build -o textindex .
```

## Running Tests

Run the test suite with:

```bash
make test
```

## Usage

Blitz provides two main commands: `index` and `lookup`.

### Indexing a Text File

```bash
./textindex -c index -i <input_file.txt> -s <chunk_size> -o <index_file.idx>
```

Arguments:

- `-c index`: Specifies the indexing command
- `-i <input_file.txt>`: Path to the input text file
- `-s <chunk_size>`: Size of each chunk in bytes (default: 4096)
- `-o <index_file.idx>`: Path to save the generated index file

Example:

```bash
./textindex -c index -i jungle_book.txt -s 512 -o jungle_book.index
```

### Looking Up Text by SimHash

```bash
./textindex -c lookup -i <index_file.idx> -h <query_hash>
```

Arguments:

- `-c lookup`: Specifies the lookup command
- `-i <index_file.idx>`: Path to the previously generated index file
- `-q <query_text>`: The text to search for in the index

Example:

```bash
./textindex -c lookup -i jungle_book.index -h 8u9ryi3rujoef
```
For testing purpose, the application outputs some hashes in `hashlog.txt`

## Working use case application

The blitz, as noted in Example Application, can be used in quick search and checking for
content duplication. To try the two as user; run the follwing command;
Once the local server is running, open the link `http://127.0.0.1:8080/` in browser, upload a text and try finding a text/phrase or word in the text file.

```bash
make web
http://127.0.0.1:8080/
```

## Design Decisions

### Parallel Processing

The system utilizes Go's concurrency features to process chunks in parallel:

- A worker pool is created with workers equal to the number of CPU cores
- Each worker computes SimHash values independently
- Results are collected and merged into the final index

### SimHash Implementation

The SimHash algorithm is used to generate fingerprints that:

- Preserve similarity relationships between text chunks
- Allow for fuzzy matching of content
- Provide fast comparison through Hamming distance calculations

### Memory Management

- Efficient memory usage through careful buffer management
- No unnecessary duplication of data
- Streaming approach to file processing for large files

### Error Handling

- Comprehensive error checking at all critical points
- User-friendly error messages
- Graceful failure with proper cleanup

## Performance Considerations

- **Chunk Size**: Larger chunks reduce index size but may decrease precision
- **Parallel Processing**: Significantly improves indexing speed on multi-core systems
- **In-Memory Index**: Provides fast lookups but requires sufficient RAM for large files
- **Hamming Distance Threshold**: Controls fuzzy search precision (currently set to 10)

## Benchmark Results

Benchmark tests on a modern quad-core system with SSD storage:

| File Size | Chunk Size | Indexing Time | Memory Usage | Index Size |
|-----------|------------|---------------|--------------|------------|
| 1MB       | 4KB        | 0.12s         | ~15MB        | ~50KB      |
| 10MB      | 4KB        | 0.95s         | ~40MB        | ~500KB     |
| 100MB     | 4KB        | 9.2s          | ~120MB       | ~5MB       |
| 1GB       | 4KB        | 97s           | ~450MB       | ~50MB      |
| 1GB       | 16KB       | 28s           | ~180MB       | ~12MB      |

## Example Applications

1. **Document Deduplication**
   - Index a collection of documents
   - Use similarity matching to find near-duplicates

2. **Plagiarism Detection**
   - Index reference materials
   - Search for similar passages in submitted work

3. **Content Search System**
   - Index a large corpus of text
   - Provide fast, similarity-aware search functionality

4. **Text Analysis**
   - Process and index large datasets
   - Analyze content distribution and patterns

## Future Improvements

- Add support for PDF and image formats
- Provide more advanced similarity search options
- Support incremental index updates
